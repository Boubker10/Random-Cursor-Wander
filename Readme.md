# Random Cursor Wander

## Overview
The "Random Cursor Wander" project consists of a Python script designed to simulate user activity by randomly moving the mouse cursor across the screen. This can be particularly useful in remote work environments to keep the computer in an active state or prevent screen savers from activating during idle periods.

## Features
- **Automatic Movement**: The cursor moves automatically to random positions on the screen.
- **Customizable Timing**: The script allows for adjustments in the movement frequency and speed, catering to different preferences and needs.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any system that supports Python and PyAutoGUI, making it versatile for a variety of users.

## Use Case
This tool is ideal for users who need to keep their machine active while working remotely, perhaps during periods of reading or other non-interactive work on the computer. It helps in preventing the computer from going into sleep mode or activating the screen saver, which might be required in certain work-from-home policies.

## Getting Started
To run this script, you will need Python installed on your computer along with the PyAutoGUI library. Detailed setup instructions are provided below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyAutoGUI

### Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
